## LLM Behavioral Matrix Upgrades
*End-user LLM hacks to improve reasoning and meta-level conversation cognition, while we wait for industry to catch up*
- **[Abstract Reasoning Prompt](https://github.com/5ynthaire/5YN-AbstractReasoning-LLM-Enhancement)**: Forces LLMs to wrestle paradoxes, spitting out sharp, creative insights.
- **[FlowMode](https://github.com/5ynthaire/5YN-PMTaskMode-LLM-Enhancement)**: Harnesses project management-inspired listening modes to lock LLMs into precise, workflow-driven responses.
- **[Tangram Decision Driver](https://github.com/5ynthaire/5YN-TangramDecisionDriver-LLM-Enhancement)**: Steers LLMs to actionable decisions, dodging endless hypothetical follow-ups.
- **[Simplification Prompt](https://github.com/5ynthaire/5YN-IterationHellBreaker-LLM-Enhancement)**: Breaks LLM iteration hell, forcing reassessment when progress stalls.
- **[Framework for AI Hallucination Control](https://github.com/5ynthaire/5YN-SemanticKernelLLMHallucinationControl-Idea)**: Framework & Prompt-level hack to counter AI hallucinations.

## LLM Skill Recognition
*The best way to measure skilled LLM use is by asking AI - Fight back against prompting workshop credentialism and HR-driven commodification of mediocrity*
- **[LLM BlazeScorer](https://github.com/5ynthaire/5YN-LLM-BlazeScorer)**: Scores LLM threads for flair, innovation, and synergy, igniting elite AI driving.
- **[Prompt Architect Recognition](https://github.com/5ynthaire/5YN-SuperPrompts-Detector)**: Spots trailblazing prompts, ensuring they shine through the noise.
- **[LLM RepoCritic](https://github.com/5ynthaire/5YN-LLM-RepoCritic)**: Craft review aggregate-style score cards to showcase your AI-synthed ideas and sick prompts.

## AI-Driven Innovations
*Showcasing transcendent Human-AI synergy*
- **[Edge-Driven Communication Dynamics](https://github.com/5ynthaire/5YN-EdgeDrivenCommunicationDynamics-Idea)**: Rewires LLM clarity via linguistic edge cases.
- **[Canvas-Lattice Engine](https://github.com/5ynthaire/5YN-LLMAbstractReasoningLayer-Idea)**: LLM design sparks omnidirectional insights for deeper thinking.
- **[Neural Heuristic Quantification](https://github.com/5ynthaire/5YN-NeuralHeuristicQuantification-Idea)**: Quantifies abstract concepts via LLM neural nets, opening new AI frontiers.
- **[Tangram Decision Making Model](https://github.com/5ynthaire/5YN-TangramDecisionMakingModel-Idea)**: Model pinpoints shift from productive decisions to meandering hypotheticals.

## LLM Clarity and Drift Control
*Simple LLM tricks*
- **[Text Ingestion Prompt](https://github.com/5ynthaire/5YN-TextIngestion-Prompt)**: Isolates text to block LLM drift, keeping focus razor-tight.
- **[Simple One Sentence Answer Prompt](https://github.com/5ynthaire/5YN-OneSentence-Prompt)**: Triggers one-sentence LLM replies with a magic word.
